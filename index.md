### *Professional Self-Assessment:*

My journey throughout my Computer Science program was very challenging but completely worth it. The reason being was because I had no prior experience in Software Engineering. I currently have a 15 year plus background in the medical field then one night working an overnight shift, I felt a desire for change in my life. A change that required more from me, a change that challenged me mentally to make me think outside the box, and find the best suitable solution. This change demanded me to apply to Southern New Hampshire University for their Computer Science Bachelor's program, concentrating in Software Engineering. One might think why such a drastic change, but I follow up with "I love technology and I inspire to make an impact on the world not only being hands-on with patients but now this time using my prior medical knowledge and experience to develop life-changing medical software."

So, completing my coursework, I was ready and knew I was going to work extremely hard with many sleepless nights. There were times where I thought I was going to give in from the tears shed due to the frustration of not knowing how to code any programming languages, not being able to figure out a specific problem(s), application(s) nor did I know a single person with any computer science background to look for help. Yet giving up has never been in my nature because I love a challenge, therefore, I prevailed like I always do! I handled each one of my course assignments one at a time and although I have neared the finish line, there is a lot more I will continuously educate myself on and practice daily to stay sharp and consistent within the field.

Showcasing my strengths required me to use languages/artifacts of choice, first, Java, and I can admit, I still have some work to do which I am willing to put forth. The next, I had hardly any experience in, MySQL. When I first started at SNHU the first language I learned was Python which seemed pretty straightforward, then came C++ which took me for a loop (literally) because I was just getting used to Python, and then the confusion started. Thereafter, Java came along, and it was like a breath of fresh air considering it was like C++, but the concepts were easier to grasp (for at least it was for me). From then on, I knew I felt comfortable and confident with programming in Java, and considering how many companies including healthcare systems use Java, I wanted to further enhance my skills by applying it to my Zoo Application. While I understood MySQL was a language that manipulated databases, we did not always have to utilize it during my program, so, I wanted to use MySQL to showcase my growth beyond my introduction to SQL course by enhancing a Messaging App from scratch using Sublime Text when it was first constructed with Codio.

I did not always work alone throughout my computer science program I collaborated in a team environment. As a team we were responsible for creating a Jukebox Playlist Application which made programming feel surreal because I was involved in a project with many others. Having this opportunity motivated me and I wanted more group interactions, but this time in the real world. This collaboration came about when I was enrolled in my CS-310 Collaboration and Team project course. In this course, we practiced appropriate change control and versioning practices using bitbucket which supported collaborations on a project via remote contributors. It was so much fun and made me eager to start in programming in the field.

During my CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course, I studied the stages of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) as a developer and tester to assess documentation and communicating effectively to stakeholders. I implemented the SDLC within an agile development environment and acquired best practices to develop high-quality software to understand the impact of communication and documentation. Overall, I enjoyed this course because I am quite an annal and thorough individual naturally, thus filling out a Software Requirement Specification (SRS Document) was useful. It allowed everyone to be on the same page and it opened the door to effective communicate to ensure our Software was designed appropriately.

Knowing how to structure an application and use the correct algorithms to allow your software to run without being harsh on your system is important. Luckily, I had the first-hand experience within CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms course. Throughout the semester, I had to develop code along with non-coding development methodologies in algorithmic design and problem-solving. Also, taking into account the need to use advanced algorithmic designs to evaluate complex data structures to aid in problem-solving. Hence, I wanted to use my Zoo Application below to showcase my understanding of the authentication system on a deeper level of the data it is composed of and how my algorithms will describe the way the data was transformed. Creating an application that was simple, easy to maintain, and faster than it was when I first created it a couple of years ago.

Software engineering and Databases were first introduced to me during my DAD-220 Introduction to SQL. I had become knowledgeable of how to create structured databases, how to manipulate them, how to analyze data through queries using CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). For this course, we used Codio and before this course, I never heard of it but learned to enjoy how sleek the IDE was as a first-time user. Thus, enjoying how simple but complex MySQL can be at times expecially if you implement the wrong code, I liked it. Since I had no other prior interaction with MySQL, I wanted to showcase my skills and growth by recreating a database management system (DBMS) to enhance a Messaging App from this specific course to display how I was able to organize the collection of data to interact with users, add extra features, and even incorporate a security factor that wasn't a part of the original application.

Security is one of the major components of Software. For security-minded professionals, only appropriate people must gain access to data in a computer system. Consequently, that is why defense programming is one of the most important approaches towards protecting a program from adverse and unforeseen circumstances. After taking my CS-405 Secure Coding and learning all about no trust and defense-in-depth, my Zoo Application was completely and utterly susceptible to vulnerabilities. My credentials and then passwords which were converted to MD5 hashes were hardcoded and bedded within the application. This course opened my eyes to why having such information within my source code allows for threat actors to insert their own hardcoded credentials, creating a backdoor to authorize attacks to hijack firmware, devices, systems, and software. For that reason, I needed to design my application with hackers in mind and test and validate all inputs. This also goes for my database Messaging application as well considering it had no security feature which meant it was too susceptible to SQL injections. For example, an attacker would've been able to locate my hardcoded credentials and impersonate a user to gain access to database privileges and create their input/content to send malicious SQL commands executed within the database. Thankfully, from all the knowledge I have obtained, my artifacts below and all my future programs will be secured using defense programming from the beginning to save time and money.

To conclude my self-assessment, I have included two artifacts (one I used twice in two different categories) that fit together to form my portfolio as a whole. Those artifacts have been briefly described earlier and they were a Zoo Application created first in my IT-145 course which I used to validate my competence in Software Design and Engineering along with my Algorithms and Data Structure categories. The other was a Messaging App Database from my DAD-220 course which demonstrates proficiency in my Databases category. Both artifacts will help exhibit the full range of my computer science talents and abilities aby proving how I was able to take a beginner's course application and enhance it over time during my computer science capstone to showcase my accumulative knowledge and perseverance on obtaining a whole new fields technology and languages without giving up. Now here I am and I'm ready for whatever challenge the world of software has in store for me and I shall conquer them!

### *Code Review:*

#### *Category One: Software Engineering/Design and Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structure*

Below is a link directly to my YouTube page where I uploaded my Code Review where I addressed the following:

[x] Existing functionality: Walk through and identify what the code is, what it does, and how it works.

[x] Code Analysis: Review the code structure, look for code efficiencies, and check for comments and code documentation. Explain your findings.

[x] Look for enhancement: Walk through and explain planned enhancements. 

This video was built using [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXFcmMqBQNA).




#### *Category Three: Databases*
For my Database category, the artifact I selected was my final project, Database Management Project Report from my DAD-220: Introduction to SQL course. This specific course covered structured query language (SQL) and how such language can be used to manage database schemas, manipulate data, and analyze data. Therefore, my report showed proficiency in inserting a person in a table, altering a person in a table, update records, delete records, alter a contact list, update records in the contact list, update records again in the contact list, insert records, create an image table, create a message-image intersection table, insert records to image table, insert records to a message-image table, find all messages sent to a specific person, find the number of messages sent to every person, and lastly, find all the messages that have at least one image attached using INNER JOINs. My enhancement plan for this project is to improve the artifact by expanding its complexity to allow for more readable codes. I also plan to add more advanced MySQL concepts to show how my knowledge in this specific programming language has expanded. I can do so by adding more users, secure codes to adopt security levels to specific users which will allow them access to only the amount of data required of them.

#### *Software Design and Engineering: Zoo Authentication Enhancement*   
![Java Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JayDob3/JayDob3.github.io/main/ePortfolio%20Images/Java-1.jpg "Software Design and Engineering: Zoo Authentication Enhancement")

The artifact I chose for my Software Design and Engineering category was my Zoo Application for User Authentication. This application was specifically designed to develop an authentication system for specific users to be granted access to only the data that was related to their role within a computer system. This final project was first created in my IT-145-J4460: Foundation in Application Development course. I was enrolled in this course during the 19EW4 semester (March 4, 2019-April 28, 2019). 

I selected this artifact because this was one of the very first courses that Java was introduced to me. I enjoyed it so much that I knew from this course I wanted to become a Java Developer. Although I became keen on the language, I knew that I had a lot more work to do to be proficient enough to gain reputable jobs once I was done with school. So, I knew the best thing for me to do was to take an application from the beginning of my program and enhance the knowledge I acquired over time. Therefore, the specific components of the artifact that showcase my skills and abilities in software development were to exploit simplicity by managing to separate my functions instead of nesting them in one class for reusability. I used best practices when designing simplistic constructors and commented them to explain my codes and method behaviors. Lastly, I coded more enhanced security features to be implemented considering my original program had all passwords hardcoded within the program which will allow for vulnerabilities of all kinds. For example:

```
while (tryCount < maxTryCount) {
      // username input
      System.out.println("Enter username:");
      String userName = scnr.readLine();

      // password input
      System.out.println("Enter password:");
      String password1 = scnr.readLine();

      if (userName.equalsIgnoreCase(EXIT_CHAR) || password1.equalsIgnoreCase(EXIT_CHAR)) {
         return;

      }

      if (AuthenticationHandler.isValidUser(credentials, userName, password1)) {
         // Show corresponding greeting for valid user
         AuthenticationHandler.showGreetings(userName);
      } else {
         // Handle wrong credential scenario
         System.out.println("Invalid username/password.");
         System.out.println();
         tryCount++;
      }
   }

   // Show as last before exiting
   System.out.println("You have exceeded the maximum amount of login attempts. Please try again later.");

}
```

Reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying my artifact, I learned how to truly focus on writing clean efficient codes and how to implement what I learned in my Secure Coding course to protect my application. I learned how to make my program complex but simplistic and portable. I improved artifact by including an admin text file, a credential text file, a veterinarian text file, a zookeeper text file, a role class, an MD5 digest class, an MD5 Hash class, a class that reads in my file, main class, and a README file that explains exactly what the program is designed to do. I needed to add comments where necessary within my codes to adhere to best practices to permit any user who will see my codes to truly understand my application. Lastly, I needed to design my application with hackers in mind by testing and validating all inputs whether it's reading from any of my text files mentioned previously, formulate algorithms that would verify user login attempts, and verify Hash passwords. As a result, I would have a Zoo Application that would adhere to all the coding standards, best practices, and showcase how my programming skills have matured through repetition in my time here at Southern New Hampshire University as a Computer Science, Software Engineering student.

#### *Algorithms and Data Structure: Zoo Authentication Enhancement*
![Java Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JayDob3/JayDob3.github.io/main/ePortfolio%20Images/Java-2.jpg "Algorithms and Data Structure: Zoo Authentication Enhancement")

The artifact I chose for my Algorithm and Data Structure category again was my Zoo Application for User Authentication. This application was specifically designed to develop an authentication system for specific users to be granted access to only the data that was related to their role within a computer system. This final project was first created in my IT-145-J4460: Foundation in Application Development course. I was enrolled in this course during the 19EW4 semester (March 4, 2019-April 28, 2019).

I selected this artifact because I wanted to show how my algorithm skills have developed over the years. I knew when I first developed the program that it did not function well and certain tasks that needed to be implemented did not work at all. Therefore, I wanted to consistently showcase my Java programming skills and enhance my program almost from scratch. The specific component of the artifact that showcases my skills and abilities in software development was my use of algorithms I developed to validate if the user credentials are valid or was invalid. I completed this within an AuthenticationHandler class which validates whether a credential is valid or is invalid with the use of Boolean statements, if-try-catch block, and when it is valid my switch statements will display the correct message. To do so, I decided that a Singleton Design pattern was best for straightforward methods and handlers which was how I designed my AuthenticationHandler class. Secondly, through the use of while and if-else statements in my main method to allow the user to input their username and password, but iterate through a loop to search for the correct credentials, exit if wanted to willingly, and exit if the credentials failed to be entered after three times keeping Big O in mind. For example:

```
// Validate if user or credentials is valid
public static boolean isValidUser(Map<String, String> credentials, String user, String pass) {

   // Validate if scenario is valid
   if (credentials == null || user == null || pass == null) {
      // Always return false for negative scenarios
      return false;
   }

   boolean isValid = false;
   Credentials cred = new Credentials(pass);
   try {
      if (credentials.containsKey(user) && credentials.containsValue(cred.generateEncryptedPassword())) {
         isValid = true;
      }
   } catch (Exception e) {
      e.printStackTrace();
   }
   return isValid;
}
```

Reflecting on the process of enhancing and modifying my artifact, it was very informational. For the fact that I was able to go back through all I obtained in school and outside of school on my own to put together a professionally and functional application. I enjoyed taking my application from a low-level beginner Java developer towards a more proficient level. I'm sure there are other factors that I can imply to continuously enhancing the program, but I am satisfied with how my program came about after subjecting all my knowledge learned. The one challenge I faced was how to implement the algorithm to ensure my application did not continuously run without exiting the program. This was an issue when I first created it, but after doing some research it all came together. My artifact was improved by formulating algorithms that would verify user login attempts, verify Hash passwords, try-catch credentials, and throw exceptions if needed.

#### *Databases: DAD-220 MySQL Database Enhancement*
![MySQL Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JayDob3/JayDob3.github.io/main/ePortfolio%20Images/MySQL.jpg "atabases: DAD-220 MySQL Database Enhancement")

The artifact I chose for my Database category was my Messaging Application to assume the role of a newly hired database engineer for an application startup. I was asked to enhance the database to support a couple of new features in the app through the use of structured query language (SQL) to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) to manage database schemas, manipulate data, and analyze data. This application was specifically designed to show proficiency in inserting a person in a table, altering a person in a table, update records, delete records, alter a contact list, update records in the contact list, update records again in the contact list, insert records, create an image table, create a message-image intersection table, insert records to image table, insert records to a message-image table, find all messages sent to a specific person, find the number of messages sent to every person, and lastly, find all the messages that have at least one image attached using INNER JOINs. This final project was first created in my DAD-220-R5643: Introduction to SQL course. I was enrolled in this course during the 19EW5 semester (May 6, 2019-June 30, 2019).

I selected this artifact because I do not utilize MySQL at all and it's a language I have very little experience using. The components of the artifact which would showcase my skills and abilities in software development are how I maintained, created, and retrieved information from a database in a table of rows and columns. Doing so I will illustrate how I can use databases and MySQL to distribute large datasets by accessing and retrieving data from innumerable databases once I reconstruct the entire program from scratch. The artifact was improved by creating advanced discrete tables for the database, add a new value to the person table called age, uploading the CSV file within my artifact, and add security factors where a user can log in but only is granted specific privileges and inhibit others. I'll also implement how I can accidentally give a user access but then revoke and then drop them. Overall, the artifact was improved by needing to completely figure out solutions on how to correctly implement the messaging app just as it was originally designed on Codio with some predefined statements. For example:


```
# Create csv file
LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE 'C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\Uploads\contact_list.csv'

.headers on
.mode csv
.output data.csv
SELECT connection_id,
		person_id,
		contact_id,
		favorite
FROM messaging.contact_list;
.quit
```

Reflecting on the process of enhancing my artifact, it was difficult to start. I was unable to utilize my virtual desktop provided by SNHU called Apporto. Therefore, trying to download MongoDB and MySQL on my MacBook was my next option and then that didn't work out for me. So, I did some research and seen that I could reconstruct my entire Messaging App via Sublime Text and be able to save it as a .sql file. I also utilized tutors to help me construct my artifact because after long hours of watching YouTube and reading up on how to construct my app, I decided to get some professional help and it worked! Even though it took some time and patients to get my app up and going, I appreciated the struggle because I did appreciate learning about MySQL a few years back, but relearning about MySQL all over again and even newly advanced statements was worth it all.
